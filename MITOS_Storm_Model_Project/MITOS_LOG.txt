MITOS-PROJECT LOG

Started 11.07.2020

11.07.2020
Created a perimeter attribute for all the MIT buildings
Created continuous values categorization for depths (5 bins)

11.08.2020
Tried Intersection tool - very few line intersections popped up... try a buffer region?
Tried spatial join intersection - output was just all the buildings

Tried many more different joins but either got 0 or just a few line intersections (I did get whole polygon intersections but it only captured those that overlapped with buildings

Made a 2ft buffer layer that helped visually see intersections, but saw that it STILL didn't intersect with the Fitness Center building ---> so I manually increased the buffer to 4ft 

Okay new approach since PolyNeighbor only takes in 1 input layer:
	1) merge buffer and storm layer -- is there a way to only include those storm polygons that are near the buildings? 
	2) Then use PolyNeighbor tool to find intersections... filter by hopefully building name?

11.09
1) did a union of both 100 year storm and mit building BUFFER layers
2) Created a point intersection layer for the buffer and storm - could use this to get lengths? but not sure how to automate the process once I figure it out
3) Ran more failed line intersections, ran poly neighbors on the union layer and took too long
