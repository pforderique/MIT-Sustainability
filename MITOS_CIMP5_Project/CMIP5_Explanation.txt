CIMP5 DATA - MATTHEW PRESTON

For a quick rundown, the file name indicates for which era (historical, rcp4.5, or rcp8.5) and variable (precip, tmax, or tmin) the mat file contains data.

Each mat file contains a struct called “results” that contains information on the era and variable as well as a GCM struct.
There’s quite a bit of information stored about each GCM, including the values and index of the lat/long coordinates closest to Cambridge (likely not very useful to you).
There’s also the raw data (“Values”) as well as information about the unit of the data and several fields related to the time series.
I set up a trim field to let me know which files I needed to remove leading or trailing data. For instance, you’ll see in the File field that some of the NetCDF files included data for December 1859, which I wouldn’t want to use as representative of the decade of the 1850s.
The last field (“Temp” or “Precip”) in the struct contains the processed data that I used to make boxplots for Ken. Those graphs are also in the Google Drive in case they are helpful as you’re working with matplotlib. Note that there is a unit conversion between raw and processed data for both temp and precip.
It may be useful for you to work first at replicating the Temp/Precip results in Python.
Once you get comfortable with the precip, tmax, and tmin files, you could play around with the HDDCDD files. Basically you take the average of the tmax/tmin and subtract from the threshold (65 degrees). Here’s a link (https://www.weather.gov/key/climate_heat_cool) that I used when I generated the graphs.
